#program to display a plot function  x ,square of x and 2 exponent x in range (0,4)

for x in range (0,4):
    # to find square of no in the range 
 squares =(x ** 2 for x in range (0,4)) 

 # to find 2 power of a no 
 power = pow (2,x)
print ( x, squares , power ) 

def (number)

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot([0,1,2,3,4][x,x**2,2**x])
plt.show()
